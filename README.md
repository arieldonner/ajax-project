# gamers-codex

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application for gamer's who want to save and organize user entered notes and links for games.

## Why I Built This

As an avid gamer myself, I would often have countless tabs open in my browser for games that I was playing. I even ended up saving some links that I hoped to come back to in a draft email which was not ideal. I wanted a place where I could keep all of my information for my games and easily come back to them whenever I wanted.
