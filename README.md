# gamers-codex

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application for gamers who want to save and organize user entered notes and links for games.

## Why I Built This

As an avid gamer myself, I would often have countless tabs open in my browser for games that I was playing. I even ended up saving some links that I hoped to come back to in a draft email which was not at all ideal. My goal for this application was to create a place where I could keep all of my information for my games organized and easily come back to them whenever I wanted.
